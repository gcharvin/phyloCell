%% Introduction
% PhyloCell is a matlab graphical user interface designed to perform cell segmentation and track cells
% from time-lapse microscopy images. 
% PhyloCell can currently handle phase contrast and fluorescence images for
% segmentation.
% The tracking method is based on the Hungarian method for assignment. 
% Once segmentation and tracking are performed, manual corrections/editions
% are possible using mouse or shortcut keys. Therefore, the whole pedigree
% of yeast microcolonies can be determined and quantified.
